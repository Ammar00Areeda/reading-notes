# what is css

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets Â· CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media 

# Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
<ul>
<li>External CSS </li>
<li>Internal CSS </li>
<li>Inline CSS  </li>
</ul>


# External css

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

# Internal css

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
 
#Inline css

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
