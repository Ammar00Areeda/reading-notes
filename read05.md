## Operators

Operators are used for JavaScript’s arithmetic expressions, comparison expressions, logical expressions, assignment expressions, and more.
Note that most operators are represented by punctuation characters such as + and =. Some, however, are represented by keywords such as delete and instanceof. Keyword operators are regular operators, just like those expressed with punctuation; they simply have a less succinct syntax.

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value

## types of loops

1- for 
syntax

# what is css

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets · CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media 

# Three Ways to Insert CSS
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
<ul>
<li>External CSS </li>
<li>Internal CSS </li>
<li>Inline CSS  </li>
</ul>


# External css

With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.

# Internal css

An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.

The internal style is defined inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
 
#Inline css

An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

# css colors

syntax

color: color|initial|inherit;
