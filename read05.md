## Operators

Operators are used for JavaScriptâ€™s arithmetic expressions, comparison expressions, logical expressions, assignment expressions, and more.
Note that most operators are represented by punctuation characters such as + and =. Some, however, are represented by keywords such as delete and instanceof. Keyword operators are regular operators, just like those expressed with punctuation; they simply have a less succinct syntax.

++   
Pre- or post-increment



--   
Pre- or post-decrement







-

Negate number







+

Convert to number







~

Invert bits







!

Invert boolean value







delete

Remove a property







typeof

Determine type of operand







void

Return undefined value







**

Exponentiate







*, /, %

Multiply, divide, remainder







+, -

+

<<

Shift left






>>

Shift right with sign extension

<, <=,>, >=

instanceof

Test object class






in

Test whether property exists



==

Test for non-strict equality



!=

Test for non-strict inequality



===

Test for strict equality



!==

Test for strict inequality



&

Compute bitwise AND



^

Compute bitwise XOR



|

Compute bitwise OR



&&

Compute logical AND



||

Compute logical OR




??

Choose 1st defined operand



?:

Choose 2nd or 3rd operand



=

Assign to a variable or property

## loops

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value

## types of loops

1- for 
syntax

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}

2- while

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

syntax

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
